This project on 0x1D. C - Binary trees is one of the main project into web creation.
 
GENERAL LEARNING OBJECTIVES:

. What is a binary tree
. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.


GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
. All your files should end with a new line
. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
. You are not allowed to use global variables
. No more than 5 functions per file
. You are allowed to use the standard library
. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
. The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
. Don’t forget to push your header file
. All your header files should be include guarded.

TASKS INVOLVED.

0. New node
mandatory
Write a function that creates a binary tree node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
And value is the value to put in the new node
When created, a node does not have any child
Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

1. Insert left
mandatory
Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node

2. Insert right
mandatory
Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.

3. Delete
mandatory
Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree

Prototype: void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to delete
If tree is NULL, do nothing

4. Is leaf
mandatory
Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf

Prototype: int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node);
Where node is a pointer to the node to check
Your function must return 1 if node is a leaf, otherwise 0
If node is NULL, return 0

5. Is root
mandatory
Write a function that checks if a given node is a root

Prototype: int binary_tree_is_root(const binary_tree_t *node);
Where node is a pointer to the node to check
Your function must return 1 if node is a root, otherwise 0
If node is NULL, return 0

6. Pre-order traversal
mandatory
Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

Prototype: void binary_tree_preorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int));
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
And func is a pointer to a function to call for each node. The value in the node must be passed as a parameter to this function.
If tree or func is NULL, do nothing
